# Prototyping wearable computing with GPS tracking system

A wearable continuous GPS tracker that can constantly locate the location of your bag or vehicle will be created as part of an Internet of Things-based application, which is currently a profoundly requested rule in which research is moving towards. This will help us with similarly thinking about how much we would love to have one of these devices, as we are probably already aware of the new VANN networks that are rapidly developing. Since there are several components to vehicular area neural networks, we must concentrate on what we determine with the on-board unit within the automobile and then which communicates with the roadside unit, which is the communicator of a Central authority. Here, we can check to see if we have this module in our onboard device, which will enable us to track the vehicle in the event of an accident. Will display what is happening on Google Map in the most reasonable manner possible. On a web-based interface that is delivered on a cloud platform, the end-user will actually have to see the accurate location of his or her lost, stolen, or taken-back vehicle. We've also supported an Android-based app that will display a fairly consistent location of pack or vehicle on their mobile device and be simple to use
